# Homework 3: Spatial Databases 

## Problem Statement
* In this homework, we worked with spatial data - create (generate/sample) some data, visualize it, do queries on it, and visualize the query results.

## Questions

#### Question 3
* Collect latitude,longitude pairs (ie. spatial coordinates) for 15 locations, in the USC campus.
* Now that we have 15 coordinates and their labels and categories, we create a KML file and each location will be a 'placemark' in .kml file (with a label, and coords), under three groups/categories [which will become 'expand/collapse' tree items, in the map software that we use to visualize the data].
* Take a snapshot of the above kml file after loading it to Google Earth.

#### Question 5
* Use the spatial db software to execute the following two spatial queries:
	- Compute the convex hull for your 15 points
	- Compute the four nearest neighbors of one of your 15 locations

#### Question 6
* Visualize the data using OpenLayers (a JavaScript API)

#### Question 7
* Using Bovard as the center, compute a set (sequence) of lat-long (ie. spatial) co-ordinates that lie along a pretty Spirograph(TM) curve
* Create a new KML file with Spirograph curve points, convert the KML to an ESRI 'shapefile', and visualize the shapefile data using ArcGIS Online.
